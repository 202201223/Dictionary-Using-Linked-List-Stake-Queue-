Dictionary Using Linked List, Stack, and Queue

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Dictionary** using fundamental data structures like **Linked List**, **Stack**, and **Queue**. It allows users to store, search, and manage words and their definitions efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Linked List**: Used to store dictionary entries (words and definitions) in a dynamic, flexible way.
- **Stack**: Provides undo and redo functionalities, allowing users to reverse recent changes such as word insertions and deletions.
- **Queue**: Implements a system to prioritize frequently accessed words, improving lookup times.

### How It Works:
- **Insert Words**: Add new words with their definitions.
- **Search**: Find the definition of any word in the dictionary.
- **Delete Words**: Remove words from the dictionary.
- **Undo/Redo**: Easily reverse or reapply recent actions using stack operations.
- **Frequent Word Access**: Frequently searched words are prioritized using a queue, making future lookups faster.

### Future Plans:
- Enhance search performance with binary search.
- Expand dictionary features to include synonyms, antonyms, and examples.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to explore data structures and their practical applications in managing data efficiently.
